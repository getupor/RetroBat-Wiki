# es\_systems.cfg

The es\_systems.cfg file is the Retrobat file located in the **EMULSTATION** folder that manages the list of systems available in Retrobat, as well as file extensions, roms paths, list of emulators/cores for the system, emulator commands, ...

For advanced users who want to **HACK** Retrobat, changes can be performed in a custom es\_systems file.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never modify the **es\_system.cfg** file located in _\emulationstation\\.emulationstation\\_, because when itâ€™s time for a Retrobat update, all your changes would be erased.
{% endhint %}
