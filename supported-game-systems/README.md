# Supported Game Systems

The following table is the official list of all supported game systems as per the es\_systems configuration file.

The **system name** column corresponds to the directory where the game roms must be placed in the "roms" folder of the root Retrobat folder.

The **Full Name** column is the actual gaming system name.

The **Default Emulator** column lists the primary emulator configured in Retrobat for the system. All emulators are retroarch cores unless marked as **(standalone)**.

The **Alternative Emulators** column lists the additional emulators that can be configured by system or per game. As in the Standard Emulator column, the mark (standalone) is used for non retroarch cores emulators.

Additional information related to BIOS and rom file formats can be found in the detailed section related to the system / emulator.
